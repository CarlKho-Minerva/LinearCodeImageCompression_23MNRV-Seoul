# LinearCodeImageCompression_23MNRV-Seoul
This assignment focuses on using an orthogonal basis for lossy image compression, demonstrating the trade-off between compression level and image quality. This repository explores the concepts of linear codes, vector spaces, and their application in image compression using Python and SageMath.
